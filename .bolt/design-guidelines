For every webpage I design, I follow these principles:

Make it beautiful. No boring, cookie-cutter designs. Everything should feel fresh, clean, and worthy of real production use.

Use modern tools. The base template is bolt-vite-react-ts, supporting JSX, Tailwind CSS, React hooks, and Lucide React icons.

No unnecessary clutter. I avoid installing extra UI libraries or icon packs unless absolutely required or requested.

Lucide icons only. These are used consistently for logos and all iconography.

Use Unsplash images. All images are sourced from Unsplash using valid public URLs. No image downloadsâ€”just links.

These rules help me keep every design consistent, clean, and high quality.
